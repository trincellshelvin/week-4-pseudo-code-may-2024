# Day 1 Problem

We will discuss a problem in class and solve it. Then you will explain the solution to the problem with your group. Make sure all members of your group understand the problem and solution. Make sure everyone has a change to participate in creating your Canva on canva.com

The goal of this problem solving exercise is to...

1. get used to the techniques of problem solving.
2. learn how to write problems and solutions out in a profession way.
3. learn to use Canva to communicate with classmates and colleagues.

## Problem for Day 1

[Sock Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/maximum-draws/problem)

There are n colors of socks in a sock drawer. You want to find a pair of
socks that are the same color. How many socks must you take out to be sure
of having a pair of the same color?

## How to write Solution and PSEUDOCODE

1. First, you must re-state the problem in your own words.
2. Then, you must give a simple example of the problem in words.
3. Next, you should create a diagram of the problem or its solution.
5. After that, you should give the formal solution using the PSUEDOCODE template. (If you wish you can write a few extra sentences to describe your solution.)
6. Finally, give at least three examples using your formal solution. (In this case, it could be, for example: n=1, n=3, and n=5)

**PSUEDOCODE template.**

(Use the following in part 5 of your solution.)

I. Declarations (use let to declare variables):

Let n be 2.     

II. Result:

Given n, the result is 3.

III. Description/Discussion

Since there are 2 colors...Therefore....you pull 3 times to get a possible pair.
