## Exercises for People in Line for Ice Cream

### Basic Problems

For each of these problems write a BOOLEAN CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION that will determine if the people can afford their desired deserts. Use variables and the greater than or less than operator in your expression.

1. Andy has $3.00 Pistachio ice cream costs $2.50 cents per cone. Chocolate ice cream costs $3.50. Can he afford to buy one cone of Pistachio? Explain. Hint: let a be how much money andy has.

2. Betty has $2.00. Can she afford to buy one cone of pistachio? Explain. Hint: let b be how much money Betty has.

3. Cathy has $5.00. Can she afford two cones of Chocolate? Explain. Hint: let c be how much money Cathy has.

4. Debby has $15.00. Can she afford three cones of chocolate? Explain. Hint let d be how much money Debby has.

5. Edward has $99.00. He has 39 friends and wants to buy himself and all his friends pistachio. Can he afford it? Explain. Hint let e be how much money Edward has. Hint: let e be how much money Edward has.

### Medium problems

1. Write a mathematical function showing how many pistachio cones a person can buy for a given amount of money. Hint: Let x be the amount of money someone has. Let y be the number of cones that can be had for the amount of money. (In Algebra, this is called a linear function.)

2. Write a mathematical function showing how many chocolate cones a person can buy for a given amount of money. Hint: Let x be the amount of money someone has. Let y be the number of cones that can be had for the amount of money.

3. Draw a graph of these functions on a xy axis. (Try using Desmos.com or drawing it on paper.)

4. (Bonus) What if someone wants a double scoop one-of-each-kind? A double scoop gets a $0.10 discount since you don't have to buy the cone. Find the mathematical function and draw a graph on the xy axis.

5. (Bonus) What if someone wants a triple scoop? Can you represent this with a single mathematical function, or do you need more than one function? Draw the function(s) a graph on the xy axis.

### Harder problems (Bonus)

1. (Bonus) Go back to your problems with Andy, Betty, Cathy, Debby and Edward. If they can't afford their desired amount they will walk away and not buy anything. How much total money will the ice cream shop make from these five people?

2. (Bonus) Can you adust the prices of the ice cream to make more money? At what price points for pistachio and chocolate can the shop take in more money?

3. Go back to the idea of BOOLEAN CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS. Re-do your boolean expressions so that they take into account the variable for how much money the people have, and also how much the store charges for pistachio and chocolate ice cream. Hint: let "pista" be the price of pistachio and "choco" be the price of chocolate. Then plug in the values for pista and choco you decided on in the last problem.
